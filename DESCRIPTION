Description: Various algorithms related to linguistic fuzzy logic: mining for linguistic fuzzy association
    rules, composition of fuzzy relations, performing perception-based logical deduction (PbLD), 
    and forecasting time-series using fuzzy rule-based ensemble (FRBE). The package also contains basic
    fuzzy-related algebraic functions capable of handling missing values in different styles (Bochvar,
    Sobocinski, Kleene etc.), computation of Sugeno integrals and fuzzy transform.
